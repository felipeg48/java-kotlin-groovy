All three languages, Java, Kotlin, and Groovy, utilize interfaces and abstract classes for defining contracts and promoting code reusability. Here's a breakdown of their functionalities:

*Interfaces*:

- Define a set of methods that *must be implemented* by classes that implement the interface.
- *Do not contain any implementation details*. They only specify the method signatures.
- *Can be used for multiple inheritance* (a class can implement multiple interfaces).

*Abstract Classes*:

- Can *contain both abstract methods* (without implementation) and concrete methods with implementations.
- *Abstract methods must be overridden* by subclasses.
- *Can be used for single inheritance* (a class can only inherit from one abstract class directly).

== Java

- *Strict approach*: Enforces clear separation between interface declaration and implementation.
- *Concrete methods in abstract classes*: Allowed, providing default behavior for subclasses.

== Kotlin

- *More concise syntax*: Interface methods can be declared without the need for the public abstract keyword.
- *Optional concrete methods in interfaces*: Kotlin allows interfaces to have default implementations marked with the default keyword.

== Groovy

- *Similar to Java*: Interface and abstract class definitions resemble Java's approach.
- *Groovy provides traits*: Traits are similar to interfaces but can also contain concrete methods. This allows for more code sharing and mixin capabilities.

*Key Points*:

- *Java*: Enforces a stricter separation between interface and implementation.
- *Kotlin*: Offers more concise syntax and allows optional default implementations in interfaces.
- Gro*ovy: Similar to Java but provides additional flexibility with traits.

*Choosing between interfaces and abstract classes*:

- Use interfaces when you want to define a contract with specific functionalities without providing any implementation details.
- Use abstract classes when you want to provide a partial implementation that can be shared by subclasses, along with forcing them to implement the remaining abstract methods.

*Additional functionalities*:

* All three languages allow interfaces and abstract classes to have:
** *Fields*: Can be declared with various access modifiers (final, static, etc.).
** *Constructors*: Can be used for initialization purposes in abstract classes.
