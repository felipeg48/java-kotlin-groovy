== Typing

- *Java*: Statically typed. Variable types are declared explicitly, and type checking happens during compilation. This ensures type safety but can lead to more verbose code.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{snippets}/java/demo/JavaApp.java[]
----

- *Kotlin*: Statically typed. Variable types can be inferred by the compiler, so you don't have to declare them explicitly. This makes the code more concise and readable.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{snippets}/kotlin/demo/KotlinApp.kt[]
----

- *Groovy*: Dynamically typed. Variable types are inferred at runtime, so you don't have to declare them explicitly. This makes the code more concise and readable, but can lead to runtime errors.

== Syntax

- *Java*: Verbose syntax with boilerplate code. Requires manual getters and setters for data access.
+

- *Kotlin*: More concise syntax compared to Java. Leverages features like extension functions and null safety for cleaner code.

- *Groovy*: Similar syntax to Java but allows for more flexibility. Supports operator overloading and closures for concise expressions.

== Usage 

- *Java*: General-purpose language widely used for enterprise applications, web development, and Android development (historically).
- *Kotlin*: Primarily targets Android development (officially supported by Google) but also gaining traction for backend development due to its conciseness and interoperability with Java.
- *Groovy*: Often used for scripting tasks, extending Java applications, and building Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs).


== Interoperability

All three languages run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can seamlessly interact with each other. Java libraries can be used in Kotlin and Groovy projects, and vice versa.



== In summary

- *Java*: Established, mature language with a vast ecosystem but can be verbose.
- *Kotlin*: Modern language with a focus on developer experience, well-suited for Android development and backend systems.
- *Groovy*: Flexible language offering dynamic typing and scripting capabilities, often used for specific tasks within Java projects.

Choosing the right language depends on your project requirements. Java remains a solid choice for large-scale enterprise applications. Kotlin is a great option for modern Android development and backend systems seeking a concise and expressive language. Groovy shines in scripting scenarios and extending Java functionalities.
