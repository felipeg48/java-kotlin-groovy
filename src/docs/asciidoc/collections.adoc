These examples showcase:

- *List*: Ordered collection that allows duplicates (e.g., ArrayList in Java, mutableListOf in Kotlin).
- *Set*: Unordered collection that does not allow duplicates (e.g., HashSet in Java and Kotlin).
- *Adding elements*: Each language has its way to add elements using methods like add or the left-shift operator (<< in Groovy).
- *Iterating*: All three languages provide mechanisms to loop through elements using for loops or functional constructs like forEach.

Remember, these are basic examples. Each language offers various collection implementations with specific functionalities like sorting, searching, and filtering.
